Taxi Order Prediction Model Training and Deployment
This project aims to train and deploy a machine learning model for predicting the number of taxi orders using historical data. The model is trained using a CatBoostRegressor algorithm and deployed as a SageMaker endpoint for inference.

Project Structure
fetch_data_from_dvc.py: Script to fetch data from DVC (Data Version Control) repository.
train_deploy.py: Main script for model training and deployment.
README.md: Documentation summarizing the project, including an overview, setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, catboost, joblib
Access to AWS SageMaker service
Data stored in a DVC repository (optional)
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:

DVC_REPO_URL: URL of the DVC repository containing the dataset.
DVC_BRANCH: Git branch name of the DVC repository.
USER (optional): User name for accessing the DVC repository (default: "sagemaker").
Training and Deployment
Fetch Data from DVC:

Run the fetch_data_from_dvc.py script to fetch the dataset from the DVC repository:

bash
Copy code
python fetch_data_from_dvc.py
Train and Deploy Model:

Run the train_deploy.py script to train the model using the fetched dataset and deploy it as a SageMaker endpoint:

bash
Copy code
python train_deploy.py --learning_rate 1 --depth 5
Adjust the hyperparameters (learning_rate and depth) as needed.
The trained model will be saved in the specified model directory (/opt/ml/model) as catboost-regressor-model.dump.
Model Serving
To serve the trained model, use the following code snippet:

python
Copy code
from train_deploy import model_fn

# Load the trained model
model = model_fn('/opt/ml/model')

# Perform inference
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
